/* AllThingsTalk Arduino WiFi SDK
 * https://github.com/allthingstalk/arduino-wifi-sdk
 *
 * About this example: 
 * Control the built-in LED of your board using your AllThingsTalk Maker.
 * Requires no external components.
 * 
 * Notes:
 * - Create a device on your https://maker.allthingstalk.com (if you don't already have it)
 * - Create an Actuator asset of type Boolean on your AllThingsTalk Maker. We'll use this asset to control the LED.
 * - The Built-In LED of the ESP8266 (and possibly other boards) is inverted by design. 
 *   Because of this, we'll need to use "HIGH" when we want to turn it off and "LOW" when we want it on.
 *
 * These are all the things in this example that you need to change to make it work: 
 *   WiFi-SSID, WiFi-Password, Device-ID, Device-Token, Actuator-Asset, LED_BUILTIN (Change only if this doesn't work for you)
